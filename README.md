# Project Name

This project was to create our own version of the classig guessing board game 'Guess Who?'

## The problem

It was hard getting to understand the existing code at first and to be able to test and se if youre progress was working accordingly. The trick was to use the console.log in the right way (and a lot).
In the beginning it was also hard to fully understand the parameters and values and to use them right. But that was also solved thanks to console-log.

New methods as fdilter() and confirm() was used.
